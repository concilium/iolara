# Iolara Campaign Content

This is Mike's experiment with deploying his campaign content for the
"Iolara" campaign (starting out in D&D 5th ed.) via the "Hugo" static
site generator utility.

Early days yet, so don't try anything until this warning disappears. :)

That being said, the general idea is:

    (local copy) -> publish to GitHub repo
                 -> (magic trigger?)
                 -> Hugo generates static site
                 -> generated site gets copied over to AWS S3 bucket
                 -> which has been configured to do static site serving

We'll see, anyway.

Mike
