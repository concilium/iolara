Pending stuff not to be forgotten:

*   Figure out which command-line switch lets me use "_config.toml" as the config path.
*   Add links to Google Analytics (sign up) and MMABP blog?
*   Get a proper logo in place.
*   Set up production deployment to AWS S3.

Should probably switch to using GitHub issues for this soonish.
