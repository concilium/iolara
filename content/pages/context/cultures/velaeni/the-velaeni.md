## Calendar

The Iolaran solar year is 355 days long.
The lunar month is 28 days long.

"Old Republican Dating" (ORD)

the priests (pontifexes) keep the calendar

there are twelve months, named after the twelve gods:
	The Three Siblings - earth (Underlord), air (Overlord), sea (the Queen)
	The Twins - the Sun Lord (Apollo) and the Moon Lady (Artemis)
	...

months are either 26-30 days long; the year is 336 days long (19 days off the solar year)
days are counted from kalends (first day of the month) and ides (13, 14, or 15 day, depending on month)
intercalary days are inserted at random intervals for special occasions
at the option of the pontifexes, an intercalary month is inserted at the end of the year, every 2-3 years, to get things back on track

The year begins in Spring, with the Grounding Day Festival.

Longer periods are marked in duodecades, e.g. "XII, 7" = "The seventh year of the twelfth duodecade."
