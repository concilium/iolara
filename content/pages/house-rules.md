## Foundation

The Iolara campaign house rules are based upon the three core rule books
for the [Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition](http://dnd.wizards.com/) roleplaying
game, as published by [Wizards of the Coast](http://company.wizards.com/):

[![Monster Manual](/images/dnd_books_mm.png)](http://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/monster-manual)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
[![Player's Handbook](/images/dnd_books_phb.png)](http://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/rpg_playershandbook)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
[![Dungeon Master's Guide](/images/dnd_books_dmg.png)](http://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/dungeon-masters-guide)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The content of these manuals (as it pertains to mechanics) is considered 
canon unless otherwise superseded by specific rule modifications as
noted below.  Content related to campaign milieu (specifics about races,
historical events, etc.) should be taken with a large grain of salt,
since the Iolara setting modifies stock assumptions considerably.
