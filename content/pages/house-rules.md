### Foundation

The Iolara campaign house rules are based upon the three core rule books
for the [Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition][dnd5] roleplaying game, as
published by [Wizards of the Coast][wotc]:

> [![Monster Manual](/images/dnd_books_mm.png)][mm]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
> [![Player's Handbook](/images/dnd_books_phb.png)][phb]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
> [![Dungeon Master's Guide](/images/dnd_books_dmg.png)][dmg]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The content of these manuals (as it pertains to mechanics) is considered 
canon unless otherwise superseded by specific rule modifications as
noted below.  Content related to campaign milieu (specifics about races,
historical events, etc.) should be taken with a large grain of salt,
since the Iolara setting modifies stock assumptions considerably. 

### Modifications

#### Inspiration

*   Modifies: DMG pp. 240-241
*   Notes:
    *   Inspiration is awarded for individual actions per the suggestions
        in the DMG (good roleplaying, heroic accomplishments, important
        victories); awarded inspiration is pooled and available for use by
        any player, with the consent of the other players present.
    *   Inspiration is tracked using the metallic "inspiration dice"
        provided by the DM; one die is added to the pool for each award,
        and one die is removed from the pool, rolled as the advantage die,
        and returned to the DM each time inspiration is used.
    *   A maximum of five inspiration dice can be in the party pool at
        any given time.
    *   Unused inspiration remaining at the end of an adventure is lost.
